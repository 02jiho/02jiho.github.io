Editor’s note: This letter was sent by Boris Kagarlitsky on February 19 from the penal colony in Torzhok, Russia, where he is serving a five-year sentence for “justification of terrorism.” As such, it does not cover more recent developments, in particular the meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and United States President Donald Trump. Nevertheless, in contains important insights for understanding what is occurring today.

After the television announced that we would now be aligning with the United States against Europe, some confusion arose among the inmates of IK-4 prison. The most well-read among them rushed to the library to request 1984 by George Orwell. A queue quickly formed.

In reality, understanding the logic of these events is not difficult. The Russian ruling elite desperately needs the support of Donald Trump’s administration to extricate themselves from the dead-end situation they have created. The trouble is that the price of this assistance may turn out to be prohibitively high.

As I have written before, for the first time in many decades, the US is governed by people who do not consider themselves bound by the rules and obligations that existed throughout the 20th century. There was much debate about the fate of the world-system described by [Immanuel] Wallerstein and the hegemony of the US. Some believed it was threatened by China’s rise, while others saw Russia’s policies as an attempt to alter or dismantle the global order. Now we understand that US hegemony is indeed coming to an end, but its destroyer is the US administration itself — because hegemony is a burden of obligations and responsibilities that Trump refuses to carry.
